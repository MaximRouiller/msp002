# Scheduling Scheduled SMS Messages with Azure Functions Timer Trigger and Twilio Programmable SMS

## Abstract

Wouldn't it be great if you could schedule a daily SMS message which provides you with current data from a resource of your choice? This is all possible with the use of Azure Functions and Twilio Programmable SMS! In this project, you'll learn about Azure Functions with a focus on the Timer trigger. Combined with the help of Twilio Programmable SMS and a GET request from the API of your choice, you can schedule daily SMS messages all from Visual Studio Code with the Azure Functions Core Tools extension.
